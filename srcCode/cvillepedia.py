    "Barracks Road": ["The Barracks Road neighborhood gives its name to the \
        Barracks Road Shopping Center. The road itself takes it name from a \
        British POW camp set up in a barracks in 1779.", "The Charlottesville \
        City Council has approved an $8.6 million Smart Scale application to \
        improve Emmet Street from Barracks Road in FY2018. The Barracks \
        Road and Emmet Street improvements project is in the design stage."], 
    "Rose Hill": ["Like many other neighborhoods, Rose Hill was a plantation \
        before it was subdivided and then annexed by the city in 1916. Many \
        of its homes were built around the time of World War II, and ghosts \
        of its industrial past — still remain. Rose Hill boasts a number of \
        amenities that other neighborhoods do not, including a pharmacy, \
        hardware store, two grocery stores, and, more recently, a \
        French-style bakery and hip barbecue spot. It’s also home to \
        Booker T. Washington Park (initially a segregated park for Black \
        citizens and built on the site of a former dump), and is close to \
        both Downtown Charlottesville and the Rt. 250 Bypass. Many longtime \
        residents worry that this neighborhood, which has historically been \
        one of the city’s more affordable areas, will be the next to gentrify."], 
    "Lewis Mountain": ["Lewis Mountain developed on land annexed by the city \
        in 1938, on a parcel that was home to the Lewis Mountain estate. \
        Surrounded by the University of Virginia’s central grounds, Lewis \
        Mountain is otherwise residential, though the university continues \
        to buy up in the neighborhood: In 2008, it purchased a chunk of land \
        at the intersection of Emmet Street and Ivy Road — one of the city’s \
        busiest — and plans to build a new entryway to the university."], 
    "Starr Hill": ["Located between downtown Charlottesville and the \
        University of Virginia, Starr Hill got its name from the many educated \
        and wealthy Black families — the stars — that called the neighborhood \
        home. But take a look at the data presented here for “racial group” to \
        see that Starr Hill’s Black population has dwindled drastically in the \
        past decade. In that time, West Main Street has been redeveloped to \
        include boutique hotels, specialty shops, and restaurants. The \
        neighborhood has close ties to Vinegar Hill, and one of its major \
        landmarks is the Jefferson School City Center, which houses a city \
        recreation center, the local African American heritage center, a \
        Caribbean restaurant, and an organization that helps people who were \
        once incarcerated re-integrate into their communities and improve their \
        lives. The building itself was for nearly 100 years a Black school, \
        until integration in 1965."],
    "Woolen Mills": ["There was indeed a woolen mill — that also manufactured \
        cotton textiles, as well as uniforms for the Confederate Army — in \
        this part of town. The older, more modest homes in Woolen Mills, as \
        well as some of the park areas, were initially built for mill workers \
        and management, with many of them built after World War II. For years, \
        the Moores Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant gave the neighborhood air \
        an unpleasant stench, but that was remedied recently, around the same \
        time a local tech company bought the empty mill building and turned it \
        into a technology campus for its staff."], 
    "10th & Page": ["Barber John West, who was born enslaved, is credited with \
        establishing this neighborhood, which hasn’t always been called 10th \
        and Page. After his emancipation, West bought a large piece of land in \
        this area and, in the late 19th and early 20th century, he subdivided \
        the property and sold the lots to Black families. While some of the \
        homes date back to the 1800s, most of the area’s development happened \
        in the 1920s, when the neighborhood was home to many employees of the \
        C&O Railroad as well as people who worked at the nearby dairy (which is \
        now a food hall with attached, newly-built luxury offices and apartments) \
        and Coca-Cola bottling plants. The neighborhood has close ties to the \
        Vinegar Hill neighborhood: Many Vinegar Hill business owners lived \
        here, and it’s where many Vinegar Hill residents landed — in the \
        Westhaven public housing community — when the city razed their own \
        neighborhood. It’s now considered one of the city’s more vulnerable \
        neighborhoods: Over the last two decades, home prices have risen \
        drastically, moreso than any other neighborhood in the city, and that’s \
        had major effects on who lives in 10th and Page today."], 
    "The Meadows": ["One of the northernmost neighborhoods in the city, The \
        Meadows neighborhood grew out of the Meadows Farm subdivision, which \
        was built off of Angus Road in the mid-1950s. A mix of renters and \
        homeowners live in the neighborhood’s midcentury ranches, duplexes, \
        and apartment buildings, and in more recent years, it’s been one of \
        the city’s more affordable neighborhoods. It’s close to many grocery \
        stores, restaurants, and shopping centers, including Stonefield and \
        Seminole Square."],
    "Martha Jefferson": ["Once part of the Locust Grove farm, this \
        neighborhood’s population grew quickly after the completion of Martha \
        Jefferson Hospital in 1903. The neighborhood’s homes were built for \
        middle- and upper-class residents and lent a suburban feel to the \
        area despite its close proximity to the downtown area, something that \
        persists. The hospital moved to Pantops in Albemarle County in 2011 \
        and the CFA Institute moved its global headquarters into the \
        building."],
    "Johnson Village": ["Single-family ranch style homes make up the Johnson \
        Village neighborhood off of Cherry Avenue, built on land annexed from \
        Albemarle County in 1964. When it was first developed, Johnson Village \
        was home to many young families, and a number of those residents \
        remain, mixed in with faculty and staff from the nearby and \
        ever-growing University of Virginia and its Medical Center."], 
    "Greenbrier": ["Greenbrier is the city’s northernmost neighborhood and \
        has a lot of green space, as it is home to McIntire Park (donated to \
        the city by Paul Goodloe McIntire as a park for Charlottesville’s \
        white citizens) as well as Meadow Creek Park, which, true to its name, \
        has a meadow, a creek, sycamore groves, and a natural marsh thought to \
        be one of just two in the Virginia Piedmont region. Like a few other \
        neighborhoods, it was part of Albemarle County before it was annexed \
        by the city in 1964."], 
    "Barracks / Rugby": ["A few, very different smaller neighborhoods make up \
        the Barracks/Rugby area, which thus has a variety of architectural \
        styles and residents of varying socioeconomic status. The Barracks \
        portion, for instance, has larger, more expensive homes built in the \
        1930s, whereas the Greenleaf section of bungalow-style homes on \
        smaller lots was built after World War II. Rugby Road, which serves \
        as a sort of transitional space between the University of Virginia \
        and residential Charlottesville, boasts mostly large, expensive homes \
        on large lots."], 
    "North Downtown": ["North Downtown is the oldest part of the city, with \
        some of its buildings (including parts of the Albemarle County \
        Courthouse, as well as the building at Number Nothing Court Square, \
        both of which played a significant role in the transatlantic slave \
        trade) dating to the 1800s. While there are residential areas of this \
        neighborhood, it’s chock-full of churches and a synagogue, a library \
        branch, a post office, the Downtown Transit Center, the Downtown Mall, \
        and more. It’s also home to the local powers that be: Charlottesville \
        City Hall, an Albemarle County office building, and all courts for \
        both Charlottesville and Albemarle County are all located here."],
    "Locust Grove": ["Beginning as the Locust Grove subdivision in the 1890s, \
        this was one of Charlottesville’s more rural neighborhoods until it \
        was built out significantly between the 1940s and 1970s, particularly \
        with the construction of the Rt. 250 Bypass starting in the late \
        1940s."], 
    "Jefferson Park Avenue": ["The Jefferson Park Ave. neighborhood borders \
        the University of Virginia grounds and was initially inhabited and \
        developed by University of Virginia professors and their families. \
        As the university has grown, more and more students have moved into \
        those older houses, and developers have built apartment buildings to \
        house even more students along the avenue, which is a main road in \
        and out of the city."], 
    "Fifeville": ["One of the city’s oldest and most dense neighborhoods, \
        the narrow streets of Fifeville have seen a number of major changes \
        in recent years — more than most other neighborhoods in \
        Charlottesville — due in large part to the significant expansion of \
        the nearby University of Virginia Medical Center. In 1822, a builder \
        who worked for Thomas Jefferson built a manor home, Oak Lawn, at the \
        corner of what is now Cherry Avenue and Ninth St. Smaller homes for \
        manor workers popped up around it. In the 1880s, a nearby farm owned \
        mostly by the Fife family was subdivided and sold to Black and white \
        families, resulting in a mixed race neighborhood to the west and a \
        working class mostly-Black neighborhood to the east. It was heavily \
        developed until the 1920s and saw very little construction until \
        recently, as the hospital has brought more white and white-collar \
        families to Fifeville."], 
    "Fry's Spring": ["Fry’s Spring gets its name from two natural springs \
        and a prominent landowner, James Francis Fry, whose Azalea Hall \
        mansion in the mid-1800s sat on a large plot of land rife with \
        apple orchards, vegetable gardens and tobacco fields. By the early \
        20th century, Fry’s estate had been subdivided and developed into \
        residential lots (and thus homes) of various sizes. While it’s home \
        to a number of families, and, increasingly, students, the area used \
        to be a vacation destination for wealthy city residents and folks \
        who’d come from Richmond and elsewhere to drink from the medicinal \
        springs."],
    "Ridge Street": ["Alexander Garrett, an enslaver and associate of Thomas \
        Jefferson, owned this parcel of land before it was subdivided \
        starting in the 1830s. The parcels on the southern end were sold \
        mainly to Black families while those on the northern end were sold \
        to white families. As automobile travel became more widespread in \
        the 1930s and ’40s, white families began moving out of the Ridge \
        Street area into the suburbs, which allowed more Black families — who \
        were legally restricted from owning property and homes in other areas \
        of the city — to buy property in the neighborhood."], 
    "Venable": ["Developed near the end of the 19th century and bordering the \
        University of Virginia grounds, Venable is another of Charlottesville’s \
        oldest neighborhoods. The Corner district originated in the mid-1800s, \
        and by the later part of the 19th century, the area was full of homes \
        for university faculty and administration, as well as boarding houses \
        for students. However, after UVA’s enrollment boom in the 1970s, many \
        of those boarding houses and homes were converted into student rentals \
        and remain that way today, with some of the larger houses owned and \
        rented by fraternities and sororities. There are now a number of \
        large apartments for students in the area, as well."], 
    "Belmont": ["Initially an estate built by one of Thomas Jefferson’s \
        bricklayers and dubbed Belle Mont by its second owner, Belmont was a \
        horse farm for a time before it was subdivided in the late 19th \
        century. Its location near corridors to the James River, Scottsville, \
        and Richmond made it an attractive spot that grew even more popular in \
        the early 1900s, when employees of the nearby C&O Railroad needed \
        housing. A majority white working-class neighborhood for a long time, \
        Belmont long had the reputation of being unwelcoming to Black \
        citizens. It’s now a mix of homeowners, renters, and, more recently, a \
        lot of Air BnBs, perhaps due to its own little “downtown” area of \
        well-regarded restaurants and its relative proximity to the Downtown \
        Mall."]
