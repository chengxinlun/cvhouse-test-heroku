    "10th & Page": "10th & Page is a Charlottesville neighborhood named for a \
        street intersection near the center of the neighborhood. The 10th and Page \
        neighborhood is one of Charlottesville's most compact neighborhoods, \
        consisting of 83.86 acres. Much of the neighborhood was developed by \
        John West, an emancipated slave who purchased land and subdivided it \
        for African American families in the late 19th and early 20th century. \
        The neighborhood was kept predominantly Black throughout the 20th century \
        due to the work of people like Charles H. Brown who sought to ensure \
        ownership stayed within African American families. The City worked \
        with the Piedmont Housing Alliance to purchase thirteen single family \
        homes for renovation. Some of these properties have been resold to \
        individual families in the hopes of increasing a family-oriented neighborhood.",
